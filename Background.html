<h1><font size="6"> What is Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE)?</font size="6"></h1>
<p><b><font size="4">Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE)</b> is a vital subject in the Philippine education system, especially in junior high school. It equips students with practical knowledge and technical skills that they can use in daily life, future employment, or business ventures. TLE is designed to help students become self-reliant, productive, and responsible members of society. It emphasizes hands-on activities, real-world applications, and the development of both manual and cognitive skills.
<BR>

<p>TLE has four major areas: <b>Home Economics, Agri-Fishery Arts, Industrial Arts, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</b>. In Home Economics, students learn about cooking, housekeeping, entrepreneurship, and caregiving. Agri-Fishery Arts teaches farming, fishing, and animal-raising skills. Industrial Arts focuses on woodworking, metalworking, electricity, and basic engineering skills. Meanwhile, ICT provides training in computer operations, digital literacy, and basic programming, preparing students for the modern technological world.

<p>The subject also introduces students to a "competency-based" approach, meaning that they learn specific skills that are measurable and can be certified. Some schools even offer TLE strands that lead to National Certificates (NC) from TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development Authority), allowing students to find jobs after high school. Overall, TLE plays a crucial role in shaping students into well-rounded individuals who are ready to face the challenges of adulthood, whether they choose to work, study further, or start their own businesses.
